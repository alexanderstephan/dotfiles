**Welcome to my *Arch Linux* Rice,**

in here you can find all the important dotfiles for my rice.

List of noticable Programs:

- urxvt   *Minimal Terminal Emulator with transparency support and a lot of customizability*
- wpgtk   *Applies a colorscheme to different configuration files using colors generated by pywal*
- rofi    *Replacement for dmenu, that can also be themed with pywal/wpgtk*
- polybar *More modern and configurable replacement for the i3bar*
- compton *Desktop compositor, thats gets rid of tearing and enables transparency*

After you installed all sufficient programs, just add the content of the template folder into the wpg folder located at ~/.config/wpg/template. After that you can easily create auto-genertated themes for i3 by using wpg's graphical frontend or it's CLI options.
